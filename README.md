# Linear and Multiple Linear Regression Analysis

This project investigates how various company expenditures influence profitability using both Linear and Multiple Linear Regression techniques. The analysis is done in Python and presented through a Jupyter notebook.

## 📌 Business Problem

The goal of this assignment is to analyze how different company expenditures impact profit. Specifically, we aim to assess if increasing spending in areas like R&D, Administration, and Marketing drives profitability, and to what extent each category contributes to overall profit.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- pandas, numpy – for data handling  
- matplotlib, seaborn – for visualization  
- scikit-learn – for building regression models

## 🔍 Workflow Summary

1. Importing required libraries  
2. Loading the dataset: `50_Startups.csv`  
3. Basic data exploration and cleaning  
4. Handling categorical variables  
5. Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
6. Splitting the dataset into training and test sets  
7. Training the regression models and evaluating performance

## 📈 Key Takeaways

- No significant outliers found  
- R&D Spend was the most impactful feature on profit  
- Model performed reliably and predictions were aligned with expected trends

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the notebook `Linear_Regression_Model_.ipynb` in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Upload the dataset file `50_Startups.csv` when prompted
3. Run each cell step-by-step to follow the full analysis

## 📂 File Structure

- `Linear_Regression_Model_.ipynb` – Main notebook containing the full analysis  
- `50_Startups.csv` – Dataset used in the project
